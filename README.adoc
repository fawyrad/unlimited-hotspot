== About
[.lead]
This guide compared to PDANet, FoxFi, NetShare, EasyTether, Wi-Fi Tether Router, TetherMe, iTether, MyWi, iPhoneModem:

. *+* Supports hotspots from *Android* phones & tablets, and *Quectel* modems.
- There is methods for unjailbroken *iOS* and *iPadOS*, however they are frustrating to handle.
. *+* Jailbreaking or rooting is not required.
. *+* Fully open-source and free of charge.
. *+* Better reliablity and internet speeds.
. *+* On "unlimited" telecom plans, grants you unlimited data for hotspots.
- Use within reason. Try not to use over two TBs (2000GB) of data in a month.
. *+* Moves past various types of throttling, such as limited video quality on YouTube or other streaming services.

== 1. Preparation

. If you use an OS that blocks Android snitching by default, such as https://grapheneos.org/[GrapheneOS]. Skip to "2. Moving past throttling".

. Quectel modems: Skip to "2. Moving past throttling".

.iOS and iPadOS
[%collapsible]
====
xref:iOS/Instructions.ADOC[See here] for the SSL method if you're willing to experiment. Contributions here would be greatly appreciated, as I can't anticipate every OS configuration and general setup, which is a requirement for these SSL and SSH methods.

====


.Rooted/jailbroken *Android*
[%collapsible]
====

. https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/[Install Magisk]; read "Getting Started", then "Patching Images".

. Download the https://github.com/felikcat/unlimited-hotspot/releases/download/v7/unlimited-hotspot-v7.zip[Unlimited Hotspot] Magisk module.
. Open Magisk -> Modules -> Install from storage -> Select the "unlimited-hotspot-v7.zip" that was downloaded.
. Reboot.

====

== 2. Moving past throttling

NOTE: For every macOS device you use, you'd have to install SpoofDPI on each. Same applies for Android devices via installing PowerTunnel, and so on for other OSes.

.Install anti-DPI applications, specific to each OS:

* FreeBSD, OpenBSD: https://github.com/bol-van/zapret/blob/master/docs/bsd.eng.md[zapret].

* macOS and Linux: https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel#configuring[PowerTunnel], https://github.com/xvzc/SpoofDPI#curl[SpoofDPI], or https://github.com/bol-van/zapret/blob/master/docs/readme.eng.md[zapret] (for macOS, use zapret's https://github.com/bol-van/zapret/blob/master/docs/bsd.eng.md[BSD instructions]).

.How to use PowerTunnel on macOS
[%collapsible]
====

. Make sure the https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel/releases[latest PowerTunnel.jar] is downloaded.

. Download the https://adoptium.net/download/[Adoptium installer] and open it.

. After you got done installing Adoptium "Temurin", in *Finder*, kbd:[Left Option] + kbd:[Right Click] PowerTunnel.jar then click "Open". +

====

* Windows: https://github.com/macronut/ghostcp[GhosTCP].
* Android: https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android#configuring[PowerTunnel for Android]; run it in VPN mode.
* iOS/iPadOS: https://apps.apple.com/in/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627[Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 app]; any other VPNs work too, but be sure to use a reptuable one that utilizes WireGuard.

=== Additional required steps
.macOS
[%collapsible]
====
. https://github.com/felikcat/unlimited-hotspot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Download Unlimited Hotspot], then open `unlimited-hotspot-main.zip` in *Finder* to extract it.
. After extracted, open the "unlimited-hotspot-main" folder, then open its "macOS" folder.
. Open *Terminal*.

. Type `sudo -i`, enter your login password, then press kbd:[Enter].
. Type `cp` then drag the `set-ios-tcp-stack.sh` file in, press kbd:[Space], type in `/var/root` and press kbd:[Enter].
. Type `cp` then drag the `felikcat.set.ios.tcpstack.plist` file in, press kbd:[Space], type in `/Library/LaunchDaemons` and then press kbd:[Enter].
. `chmod +x /var/root/set-ios-tcp-stack.sh`
. `launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/felikcat.set.ios.tcpstack.plist`

.Now we need to add three Packet Filter rules and enable PF.
. `nano /etc/pf.conf`
. Add the following three lines before `nat-anchor`: +
image:pf_rules.png[]
. `pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf` then `pfctl -e`

=== Routers
For Quectel modems, or if the hotspot device is plugged into a router, then these steps are required:

.Asuswrt-Merlin
[%collapsible]
====
. `Advanced Settings - WAN` -> disable `Extend the TTL value` and `Spoof LAN TTL value`.
. `Advanced Settings - Administration`
- `Enable JFFS custom scripts and configs` -> "Yes"
- `Enable SSH` -> "LAN only"
. Replace the LAN IP and login name if needed: `$ ssh 192.168.50.1 -l asus`
- Use other SSH clients if preferred, such as MobaXterm or Termius.
. `# nano /jffs/scripts/wan-event`

[source, shell]
----
#!/bin/sh
# shellcheck disable=SC2068
Say() {
  printf '%s%s' "$$" "$@" | logger -st "($(basename "$0"))"
}
WAN_IF=$1
WAN_STATE=$2

# Call appropriate script based on script_type
SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME="wan${WAN_IF}-${WAN_STATE}"
SERVICE_SCRIPT_LOG="/tmp/WAN${WAN_IF}_state"

# Execute and log script state
if [ -f "/jffs/scripts/${SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME}" ]; then
  Say "     Script executing.. for wan-event: $SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME"
  echo "$SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME" >"$SERVICE_SCRIPT_LOG"
  sh /jffs/scripts/"${SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME}" "$@"
else
  Say "     Script not defined for wan-event: $SERVICE_SCRIPT_NAME"
fi

##@Insert##
----

`# nano /jffs/scripts/wan0-connected`
[source, shell]
----
#!/bin/sh

# HACK: I am unsure of what to check.
## Do this too early and the TTL & HL won't be set.
sleep 5s; modprobe xt_HL; wait

# Removes these iptables entries if present.
# WARNING: Only removes these entries once, and never assumes the same entries are present twice.
iptables -t mangle -D PREROUTING -i usb+ -j TTL --ttl-inc 2
iptables -t mangle -D POSTROUTING -o usb+ -j TTL --ttl-inc 2
ip6tables -t mangle -D PREROUTING ! -p icmpv6 -i usb+ -j HL --hl-inc 2
ip6tables -t mangle -D POSTROUTING ! -p icmpv6 -o usb+ -j HL --hl-inc 2

# Move past TTL & HL hotspot detections.
## Increments the TTL & HL by 2 (1 for the router, 1 for the devices connected to the router).

ip6tables -t mangle -I POSTROUTING ! -p icmpv6 -o usb+ -j HL --hl-inc 2
----
Now, set permissions correctly to avoid this error: `custom_script: Found wan-event, but script is not set executable!` +
`# chmod a+rx /jffs/scripts/*` +
`# reboot`

=== Quectel modems

[%collapsible]
====
CAUTION: Never spoof to an IMEI of a device you do not own, you will block the device of whoever uses it -- but only if it's on the same telecom. +
It is also illegal in the United States to spoof to an IMEI of a device that is not owned by you.

.You need to spoof the Quectel modem's IMEI to a phone or tablet you own that has mobile data capability:
* `AT+EGMR=1,7,"The IMEI here"`
====

== 3. Using dnscrypt2 to get past webpage blocks

https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Installation[Installation instructions for other OSes], such as Windows, Linux, etc.

.macOS
[%collapsible]
====
. Go to https://ipleak.net/[AirVPN's IP Leak] to see your current DNS servers. Save a screenshot of this page.

. https://brew.sh/[Install Homebrew] if you haven't already.

. `brew install dnscrypt-proxy`

. Be sure to read the information Brew gives you after it's done installing dnscrypt-proxy.
- It is recommended to install dnscrypt-proxy's service.

. Open *Settings*, go to Network, then click on the Network interface you are currently using; for me, that is "USB 10/100/1G/2.5G LAN".
. Click "Details..." +
image:settings_dnscrypt.png[]
. Go to DNS, press the Plus (+) button under "DNS Servers", then type in `127.0.0.1` +
image:settings_dnscrypt_2.png[]

. Go back to https://ipleak.net/[AirVPN's IP Leak] to see if the changes to your DNS servers is successful; compare it to your prior screenshot.

====

== 4. Confirm the hotspot is un-throttled

* Use https://fast.com[Netflix's Speedtest], then compare that result to https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat[Waveform's Bufferbloat Test]. +
- This tests for throttling of streaming servers (Netflix), various forms of data fingerprinting, and hotspot detections.



== 5. Improving internet speeds

.For Android: Enable Data Saver
* This only works via USB, as it will block wireless hotspots.
- Context: Data saver tells Android to restrict data to only the USB hotspot and which app is at the forefront.

.Disable roaming
* *Android & iOS*: Search for "Roaming" in the Settings app, then disable it.
- Context: Roaming to a different telecom usually has unavoidable throttling. Roaming kicks in when signal strength is either very poor or non-existent from your telecom. In T-Mobile USA's case, they roam on AT&T with only up to 250kbps download & upload speeds on AT&T's towers.

.Switch cell tower providers specifically for problematic areas
* *iOS*: Context: T-Mobile owns Sprint's towers. For me, Sprint has consistently better speeds at my home. +
image:ios_network_selection.PNG[width=281.5,height=305]

.(Android with Magisk only) -> Using specific 4G, LTE, 5G NA, or 5G SA bands.
. Install https://apkpure.com/netmonster/cz.mroczis.netmonster[NetMonster] for its network monitoring. Without NetMonster, you are blind to what bands are used, and their signal strength.

. Install https://apkpure.com/network-signal-guru/com.qtrun.QuickTest[Network Signal Guru] then use it to set the allowed LTE bands to only the "LTE 4x4 Bands" listed on https://cacombos.com/device/G025E[cacombos.com] for your device. This could stabilize your speeds, and can potentially increase speeds.

. If the ads bother you, enable Systemless Hosts in Magisk's settings, then install https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/releases[AdAway] and use its Root method; do not use its VPN method.

TIP: *Android* -> Only if you have high ping or ping spiking issues: try disabling "hotspot hardware acceleration" in the Settings app.

Tip me if you want more pre-paid United States telecoms tested, such as AT&T, Verizon, and third-party MVNOs using say AT&T's network like Cricket Wireless. As of Sep 10 2023: I've only tested with a Magenta T-Mobile plan, with me maxing out its hotspot data out.
