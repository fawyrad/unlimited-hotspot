.Non-jailbroken *iOS and iPadOS*; SSH method. WORKS BUT INCOMPLETE!
[%collapsible]
====
*The client has to make its own hotspot for the iOS/iPadOS device to connect to. Here's the instructions for each OS:*

WARNING: The macOS instructions rely on deprecated functions of the OS, and are unreliable. If you're willing, you'd have a nicer time on Asahi Linux (for M1 or newer "arm64" Macs). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iiFhhOkv14[Here's a tutorial video.]
.macOS
. Open Terminal.
. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519; chmod -R 700 $HOME/.ssh`
- When prompted for a "file in which to save the key", keep pressing kbd:[Return] until completed.

. `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | base64 | base64 -d > ~/publickey.txt | pbcopy`
- This will copy the result to the clipboard; the clipboard is synced between Apple devices.

. On the iPhone or iPad: `nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, then paste the clipboard, and save the file. 

. `sudo -- zsh -c "networksetup -createnetworkservice Loopback lo0; networksetup -setmanual Loopback 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255; networksetup -createnetworkservice AdHoc lo0; networksetup -setdhcp AdHoc"`

. `pip3 install rsp`

. Open *Settings*.
. Make sure to disable all Filters & Proxies already inside of "Network". +

. Move Loopback to the bottom, and put AdHoc right above Loopback. +

. Click the (i) icon for Internet Sharing. +

. Copy these settings, then click "Wi-Fi Options..." and allow the permissions when prompted. +

.Now turn on Internet Sharing every single time you want to use your iOS/iPadOS hotspot.
* Ensure that this icon shows up, if it doesn't, disable Wi-Fi then enable Internet Sharing: +

.Linux -> GNOME and NetworkManager
. Replace wpa_supplicant (Ubuntu and Fedora both use it) with iwd, otherwise the iOS/iPadOS device cannot connect to the Linux hotspot.

. `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
- When prompted for a "file in which to save the key", keep pressing kbd:[Return] until completed.

. `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | base64 | base64 -d > ~/publickey.txt | pbcopy`


.Now, back to the iOS or iPadOS device.
. Install https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243[iSH] and https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229[LocalSend].
- LocalSend is so you can send files to macOS or other OSes; AirDrop will not work on macOS while hosting Wi-Fi.

. Install https://localsend.org/#/download[LocalSend] onto the device you are sharing a hotspot to.

. Open iSH, then run `iOS/install_ssh.sh`
- When prompted for a "file in which to save the key", keep pressing kbd:[Return] until completed.

.Now connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot made on your client, and ensure mobile data is used through the following steps:
. Open the *Control Centre* by pulling down from the top-right.
. Tap and hold on the Wi-Fi icon, then enable *Personal Hotspot*.
. You can `ping goo.gl` inside *iSH* to see if the mobile data is functional.

.If that method doesn't work, try the following:
. Open *Settings*, go to Wi-Fi.
. Press the Info (i) icon for the Wi-Fi hotspot.
. Note the IP Address and Subnet Mask, remember these both, it is important.
. Configure IP -> Change to "Manual", then put in the same IP Address and Subnet Mask, but leave Router empty, then save.
NOTE: Every single time you reconnect to this Wi-Fi hotspot, you must set it back to "Automatic" to get back on the Wi-Fi, then change to "Manual" to make the Mobile Data work.

.Run the SSH tunnel on the iOS/iPadOS device:
. `/usr/sbin/sshd -d`
- After done testing, remove -d (debug mode), as it'll close `sshd` everytime a client disconnects.
