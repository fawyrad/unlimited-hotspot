WARNING: These instructions are incomplete, and I'm not willing to go further.

== 1. The client needs its own hotspot for iOS/iPadOS to connect to; here's the instructions for each OS:

.*macOS client*
. `sudo -- zsh -c "networksetup -createnetworkservice Loopback lo0; networksetup -setmanual Loopback 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255; networksetup -createnetworkservice AdHoc lo0; networksetup -setmanual AdHoc 10.0.4.1 255.255.255.0; pfctl -e"`

. Open *Settings*.
. Make sure to disable all Filters & Proxies already inside of Network -> VPN. +

. Move Loopback to the bottom, and put AdHoc right above Loopback. +

. Turn on your Wi-Fi, then unplug your iPhone or iPad from the Mac before proceeding.

. Click the (i) icon for Internet Sharing. +

. Copy these settings, then click "Wi-Fi Options..." and allow the permissions when prompted. +

.*Now turn on Internet Sharing every single time you want to use your iOS/iPadOS hotspot.*
* Ensure that this icon shows up, if it doesn't, disable Wi-Fi and AirDrop then enable Internet Sharing: +

.*Linux client*
. Replace wpa_supplicant with iwd, otherwise the iOS/iPadOS device cannot connect to the Linux hotspot.


.*Back to the iOS or iPadOS server.*
. https://github.com/felikcat/unlimited-hotspot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Download Unlimited Hotspot], then open `unlimited-hotspot-main.zip` in *Files* to extract it.

. After extracted, open the "unlimited-hotspot-main" folder, then open its "iOS" folder. 

. Install https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243[iSH].

. Open Files, move the `install_ssl.sh` file to iSH's `/root` directory using the *Files* app.

. Open iSH, then run: `sh install_ssl.sh`
- When prompted for a "file in which to save the key", keep pressing kbd:[Return] until completed.

. Now connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot made on your client, and ensure mobile data is used through the following steps:
. Open *Settings*, go to Wi-Fi.
. Press the Info (i) icon for the Wi-Fi hotspot.
. Note the IP Address and Subnet Mask, remember these both, it is important.
. Configure IP -> Change to "Manual", then put in the same IP Address and Subnet Mask, but leave Router empty, then save.
NOTE: Every single time you reconnect to this Wi-Fi hotspot, you must set it back to "Automatic" to get back on the Wi-Fi, then change to "Manual" to make the Mobile Data work.

. Run the SSH tunnel on the iOS/iPadOS device: +
`stunnel`

.*Back to the macOS client.*

. https://github.com/felikcat/unlimited-hotspot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Download Unlimited Hotspot], then open `unlimited-hotspot-main.zip` in *Finder* to extract it.

. After extracted, open the "unlimited-hotspot-main" folder, then open its "macOS" folder.
. Open *Terminal*.
. `brew install stunnel`

. `openssl s_client -showcerts -servername server -connect 192.168.2.66:9080 > RootCACert.pem`
. Open Keychain Access.
. Drag the Root CA certificate into Keychain Access, and fully trust it.

. INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS END HERE.

== Warnings
. The iOS or iPadOS device must always have its screen on during the hotspot, with only the iSH app open.
- You cannot switch away from the iSH app while using the hotspot.

. You will have slower internet, but it should be minimal.
